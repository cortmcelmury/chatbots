# Simple rule-based chatbot - feel free to expand on this ruleset
# Some kinks to work out - replacing the pronouns could use a bit more fine-tuning
# Ex: "I" gets replaced by "you" no matter if it's by itself (correct) or an "i" in another word (incorrect)


# Putting it all together I
# It's time to put everything you've learned in the course together by combining
# the coffee ordering bot with the ELIZA rules from chapter 1.

# To begin, you'll define a function called chitchat_response(), which calls the
# predefined function match_rule() from back in chapter 1. This returns a response
# if the message matched an ELIZA template, and otherwise, None.

# The ELIZA rules are contained in a dictionary called eliza_rules.
